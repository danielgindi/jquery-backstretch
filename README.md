# Backstretch

Backstretch is a simple jQuery plugin that allows you to add a dynamically-resized, slideshow-capable background image to any page or element. The image will stretch to fit the page/element, and will automatically resize as the window/element size changes.

## Original Repository

Is here: https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch  
But we haven't seen any kind of activity by the author for about 2 years already. So I've taken the PRs that were there and merged them carefully, with some improvements and cleanup. This fork is the result.

## Demo

There are a couple of examples included with this package, or feel free to check it out live [on the project page itself](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/).

## Setup

Include the jQuery library (version 1.7 or newer) and Backstretch plugin files in your webpage (preferably at the bottom of the page, before the closing BODY tag):

```html
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.backstretch.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // To attach Backstrech as the body's background
  $.backstretch("path/to/image.jpg");

  // You may also attach Backstretch to a block-level element
  $(".foo").backstretch("path/to/image.jpg");

  // If your element defines a background image with CSS, you can omit the argement altogether
  $(".foo").backstretch();

  // Or, to start a slideshow, just pass in an array of images
  $(".foo").backstretch([
    "path/to/image.jpg",
    "path/to/image2.jpg",
    "path/to/image3.jpg"    
  ], {duration: 4000});

  // Or, to load from a url that can accept a resolution and provide the best image for that resolution
  $(".foo").backstretch([
    "path/to/image.jpg?max_width={width}&max_height={height}"
  ]);

  // Or, to automatically choose from a set of resolutions
  // (Each width specifies the minimum resolution for specific image)
  $(".foo").backstretch([
    [
      width: 720, url: "path/to/image1_1080.jpg",
      width: 320, url: "path/to/image1_720.jpg",
      width: 0, url: "path/to/image1_320.jpg"
    ],
    [
      width: 720, url: "path/to/image2_1080.jpg",
      width: 320, url: "path/to/image2_720.jpg",
      width: 0, url: "path/to/image2_320.jpg"
    ]
  ]);
</script>
```

## Options

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| `alignX` * | This parameter controls the horizontal alignment of the image. Can be 'center'/'left'/'right' or any number between 0.0 and 1.0. | Integer or String | 0.5 |
| `alignY` * | This parameter controls the vertical alignment of the image. Can be 'center'/'top'/'bottom' or any number between 0.0 and 1.0. | Integer or String | 0.5 |
| `fade` * | This is the speed at which the image will fade in. Integers in milliseconds are accepted, as well as standard jQuery speed strings (slow, normal, fast). | Integer or String | 0 |
| `fadeFirst` | If `true`, the first image will fade in like all the others. | Boolean | true |
| `duration` * | The amount of time in between slides, when using Backstretch as a slideshow, expressed as the number of milliseconds. | Integer | 5000 |
| `paused` | For slideshows: Disables the change between slides | Boolean | false |
| `start` | The index of the image in the array you want to start your slideshow with. | Integer | 0 |
| `preload` | How many images to preload at once? I.e. Lazy-loading can be enabled by specifying 0. | Integer | 2 |
| `preloadSize` | How many images to preload in parallel? If we are preloading 5 images for the next slides, we might want to still limit it to only preload 2 or 3 at once, according to the expected available bandwidth. | Integer | 1 |
| `centeredX` | Deprecated. Still works but please do not use it. | Boolean | true |
| `centeredY` | Deprecated. Still works but please do not use it. | Boolean | true |

* Options marked with an `*` can be specified for individual images

## Slideshow API

Once you've instantiated a Backstretch slideshow, there are many actions that you can perform it:

```javascript
// Start a slideshow
$('.foo').backstretch([
  'path/to/image.jpg',
  'path/to/image2.jpg',
  'path/to/image3.jpg'
]);

```javascript
// Slideshow with granular control
$('.foo').backstretch([
  { url: 'path/to/image.jpg', duration: 3000 }
  { url: 'path/to/image2.jpg', fade: 250 },
  { url: 'path/to/image3.jpg', alignY: 0.2 }
]);

// Pause the slideshow
$('.foo').backstretch("pause");

// Advance to the next slide
$('.foo').backstretch("next");
```

| Method | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.backstretch("show", n)` | Jump to the slide at a given index, where n is the number of the image that you'd like to display. Slide number starts at 0. |
| `.backstretch("prev")` | Display the previous image in a slideshow. |
| `.backstretch("next")` | Advance to the next image in a slideshow. |
| `.backstretch("pause")` | Pause the slideshow. |
| `.backstretch("resume")` | Resume a paused slideshow. |
| `.backstretch("destroy", preserveBackground)` | Destroy the Backstretch instance. Optionally, you can pass in a Boolean parameter, preserveBackground, to determine whether or not you'd like to keep the current image stretched as the background image. |
| `.backstretch("resize")` | This method is called automatically when the container (window or block-level element) is resized, however you can always call this manually if needed. |
| `.backstretch("gravity", g)` | Set the alignment (NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast) for the next image. |

## Public Variables

Sometimes, you'll want to access Backstretch's images after you've instantiated the plugin. For example, perhaps you'd like to be able add more images to a slideshow. Doing so is easy. You can access the images array as follows:

```javascript
$('.foo').backstretch([
  'path/to/image.jpg',
  'path/to/image2.jpg',
  'path/to/image3.jpg'
]);

// Access the instance
var instance = $('.foo').data('backstretch');

// Then, you can manipulate the images array directly
instance.images.push('path/to/image4.jpg')
```

Additionally, the current index of a slideshow is available through the instance as well:

```javascript
$("body").data("backstretch").index;
```

## Events

### backstretch.before

Backstretch will fire a "backstretch.before" event before a new image loads, triggering a function that is passed the event, Backstretch instance, and index of the image that will be displayed. If you listen for that event, you can, for example, coordinate other changes to coincide with your slideshow.

```javascript
$(window).on("backstretch.before", function (e, instance, index) {
  // If we wanted to stop the slideshow after it reached the end
  if (index === instance.images.length - 1) {
    instance.pause();
  };
});
```

### backstretch.after

Backstretch will also fire a "backstretch.after" event after the new images has completed loading.

```javascript
$(window).on("backstretch.after", function (e, instance, index) {
  // Do something
});
```
